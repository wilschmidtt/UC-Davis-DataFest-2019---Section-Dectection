# UC Davis DataFest 2019 - Section Detector
#### The Challenge 
The UC Davis Library has over 200 scanned catalogs spanning nearly a 50 year period. How do we translate a scanned image
into usable data for economists, historians, archivists, and other researchers?
#### Hypothesized Solution
Unstructured text recognition using Python and Spyder. Utilize Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and sklearn. Clustering 
by feature location was done with K-Means machine learning algorithm.
